# Maze solving challenge

A simple numerical maze solving program. We explore the maze recursively by visiting each cell and avoiding walls and previously visited cells.

# Requirements

 This project was implemented using Python 3.6.8 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. \
 It should run on any Python 3.x.

# Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/sandeep-mistry/maze-solving-challenge.git
cd maze-solving-challenge/src
python3 main.py
```
# Notes

When entering starting point coordinates please bear in mind that Python begins counting from zero. Hence the coordinates of the value '1' in the matrix below are (0,0), '5' is (1,1), etc. 

1 2 3 \
4 5 6 \
7 8 9
